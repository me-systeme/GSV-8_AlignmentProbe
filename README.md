# GSV-8_AlignmentProbe
Alignment Viewer is a Windows application written in python designed to support mechanical testing according to ASTM E1012. The software communicates with a ME-Systeme GSV-8 amplifier (via MEGSV86x64.dll) and provides real-time visualization of axial strain and bending strain for two orthogonal measurement planes.
